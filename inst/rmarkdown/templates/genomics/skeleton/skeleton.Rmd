## About

This document is a jumping space for this analysis, and all following anlayis related to this project. Interesting information about this project is encoded in the YAML header of the HEADER.Rmd file. This seems like a decent way to implement the conventions described by Chris Seidel in his [confluence discussion](https://confluence.stowers.org/display/GENOME/YAML+encoded+project+parameters) about the usefulness YAML metadata. The metadata is not used directly yet in this document, but could be exploited by scripts in parent directories.

## Data

The data for this project can be found [Here](bioinfo/n/data1/genomes/AstMex102)

## Results

Here are some things we found: 

```{r}
x <- 1:10 
y <- exp(x) 

plot(y, x, 
     main = 'An exponential') 
```
