## About

This document is a jumping space for this analysis, and all following anlayis related to this project. Interesting information about this project is encoded in the YAML header of a HEADER.Rmd file. This seems like a decent way to implement the conventions described by Chris Seidel in his [confluence discussion](https://confluence.stowers.org/display/GENOME/YAML+encoded+project+parameters) about the usefulness YAML metadata. The metadata is not used directly yet in this document, but could be exploited by scripts in parent directories.
